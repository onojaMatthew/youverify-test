# E-Commerce Microservices Application

This is a Node.js microservice-based e-commerce application. It uses `RabbitMQ` for asynchronous communication. There is also an `API-GATEWAY` service that handles all requests and proxy them to the desired services. Below is a sample 
structure of the different services.

# APPLICATION STRUCTURE (Service)

Below is the structure of the services. All the services follow the same structure and naming convention and are collective in a parent folder.

`product-service/
├── src/                          # Source code directory
│   ├── config/                   # Configuration files

## Services

There are five(5) different services in the application. The services are as listed below:

1.  `api-gateway` is the service that receives all the requests going into the application and redirects them to the appropriate services.
2.  `customer-service` is responsible for customer account registration and management
3.  `order-service` is responsible for order management
4.  `payment-service` handles payment
5.  `product-service` for product management

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
1.  Runtime: `NodeJS`
2.  Framework: `ExpressJS`
3.  Database: `MongoDB`
4.  Containerization: `Docker and docker-compose`
5.  Message broker: `RabbitMQ`

## 📦 API Documentation

I have export a Postman collection for the APIs implemented. It is in the root directory of the application with the name: `Youverify-collection.json`. You can import it into Postman and make use of them.


## Getting started

To get started with the application, first clone the application from github by running the command below:

1.  run: `git clone https://github.com/onojaMatthew/youverify-test.git`

2.  run `cd youverify-test`. In this directory, all the different services are located.

### To run API Test

API testing can be run at the service level. This means that each service is tested in isolation but it requires other services to be running for communication purposes. Below is a detail information of how to test the APIs:

#### Testing the product service

Do the followings:

1.  `cd product-service`
2.  run `npm install`
3.  create a `.env` file in the product-service root directory. i.e `product-service/.env`
4.  Add the environment variables below to the .env file you created in step 3.
    `
      PORT=5100
      MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/products
      RABBITMQ_URI=amqp://admin:password@localhost:5672
    `
5.  run `npm run test`. This command should be run from the service root directory. See the structure below:

`product-service/
├── src/                          # Source code directory
│   ├── config/                   # Configuration files

#### Testing the Order Service

Do the followings:

1.  `cd order-service`
2.  run `npm install`
3.  create a `.env` file in the `order-service` root directory. i.e `order-service/.env`
4.  Add the environment variables below to the .env file you created in step 3.

#### Testing the Payment Service

Do the followings:

1.  `cd payment-service`
2.  run `npm install`
3.  create a `.env` file in the `payment-service` root directory. i.e `payment-service/.env`
4.  Add the environment variables below to the .env file you created in step 3.

└── package.json`


Below are the steps that must be followed to run the application successfully.

1.  #### Build the docker containers
    From the general root directory i.e `youverify-test/` there is a `docker-compose.yaml` file used to build and run docker files. Run the command below to in this directory to execute the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

    run `docker-compose up --build` or `docker-compose up --build -d`. With the `-d` flag, you're are telling process to run in the background after a successful.

2.  When step 1 is successful, you can then access the application following the Postman collection I have dropped in  the root folder.


## Running the application outside docker container

After the environment variables are properly set as shown above, you can run each of the services as follows:

### NOTE: you must run all the services first before you can run the API-Gateway service as it depends on them.

Follow these steps:

1.  `cd product-service` and run `npm run dev`
2.  `cd order-service` and run `npm run dev`
3.  `cd customer-service` and run `npm run dev`
4.  `cd payment-service` and run `npm run dev`
5.  `cd api-gateway` and run `npm run dev`
